# HunterMissionScraper

This is a tool for use with the game theHunter Classic. Doing missions is an important part of this game, but the way the mission descriptions are displayed on the game's website is awkward. This script uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape the site and save the mission descriptions conveniently in a text file.

This is something many players do manually by copying and pasting, so the script doesn't give the user any unfair advantage, it just saves a little time.
